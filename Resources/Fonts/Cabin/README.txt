Cabin Variable Font
===================

This download contains Cabin as both variable fonts and static fonts.

Cabin is a variable font with these axes:
  wdth
  wght

This means all the styles are contained in these files:
  Cabin-VariableFont_wdth,wght.ttf
  Cabin-Italic-VariableFont_wdth,wght.ttf

that arenâ€™t available as static fonts. Not all apps support variable fonts, and
